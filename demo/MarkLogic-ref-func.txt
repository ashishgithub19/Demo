1. Collations:

A collation specifies the order for sorting strings.
collations determine uniqueness in string comparisons, so two strings that are equal according to one collation might be not be equal according to another.

 For example, a code point sort puts all uppercase letters before lower-case letters, so the word Zounds sorts before the word abracadabra.
 If you use a collation that sorts upper and lower-case letters together (for example, the order A a B b C c, and so on), then abracadabra sorts before Zounds.
 
 
The following are two very common collation URIs used in MarkLogic Server:
